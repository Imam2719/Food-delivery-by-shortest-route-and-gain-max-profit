Title : Food delivery by shortest route and gain max
profit.
Problem Discussion: A robot called FoodMe wants to deliver in a
town Dhaka and the seller wants to gain maximum profit and chooses
a path so that the robot can reach his buyer with the shortest distance.
Introduction: The problem aims to optimize delivery services by
implementing two key algorithms - the Dynamic programming
algorithm for maximizing profits with a given range of weight such as
0/1 knapsack problem and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest
paths between the office and various customer locations.
The algorithm we use to solve the problem given below:
- Dynamic Programming (DP):
The 0/1 Knapsack algorithm is employed to maximize the profit
earned by a delivery robot, given a limited weight capacity.For
example The delivery robot can carry a maximum weight of 50 units
and is presented with items of varying weights and profits. The
algorithm efficiently computes the optimal selection of items to carry,
maximizing the total profit.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm:
Dijkstra's algorithm is utilized for efficient routing in a delivery network.
The network is represented as an adjacency matrix, where each edge
denotes the distance between two locations. The algorithm calculates
the shortest paths from the office to all customer locations, providing
an optimized routing solution.
